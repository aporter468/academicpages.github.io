I am a PhD student in computer science at Stanford, advised by Professors [Mary Wootters](https://sites.google.com/site/marywootters/) and [Jure Leskovec](https://cs.stanford.edu/~jure/). My current research interests are in error correcting codes for distributed storage and computation, and analysis of temporal networks.

I completed my undergraduate at Arizona State University, where I worked with Professor Andrea Richa on the [Self-Organizing Particle Systems](https://sops.engineering.asu.edu/) project. I graduated in May of 2017 with a B.S. in Computer Science and a B.S. in Mathematics.
